# Background

China, Japan and Greenland are the three countries with the highest incidence of esophageal cancer in the world. Here I discuss the reasons behind this and the implications derived from it

# Possible Contributing Factors

As we can see, the high incidence of esophageal cancer is concentrated in China and Japan. It is also very high in certain region of Europe, such as the United Kingdom. This is most likely from the contributing factors of esophageal cancer: Alcohol usage, smoking and specific dietary habits and diet structure.
- The specific dietary structure of China and Japan, with a diet high in sugar and salt, may have a large influence
- In addition the culture of drinking hot water and hot tea (China, Japan, UK) may also have an increased incidence.
- However, the effects of alcohol and smoking may not be significant in comparison, and it can be seen that the incidence of esophageal cancer in areas with heavy alcohol consumption is not as high as in China, for example.
- Greenland, with its small population and low population mobility, may have a genetic and hereditary level of vulnerability

After making a preliminary estimate of the contributing factors of esophageal cancer, we observed this significant difference in the incidence of esophageal cancer between men and women. Both globally and by region of high prevalence. The incidence of esophageal cancer was significantly higher in men than in women. The incidence of esophageal cancer in men is more than twice as high as that in women in most regions.

There are several hypotheses for this difference in incidence rates:

1. men and women have different intake of carcinogenic substances such as alcohol in their lives. However, this clearly does not explain such a large difference. In a cross-regional comparison, the effect of smoking and alcohol was significantly lower than the effect of dietary habits.
2. Men consume less fruit, fewer vegetables, but more meat than women. A low fruit and vegetable diet is one of the risk factors for esophageal cancer. It can be seen that Taiwan has a lower incidence of esophageal cancer compared to China, Japan, which has a higher per capita intake of fruits and vegetables. Therefore, it is possible that this difference in behavior may contribute to the difference in incidence rates between men and women. 
3. The difference in dietary preferences between men and women. This explanation also has a major flaw. It can be seen that the incidence of esophageal cancer does not increase significantly until after the age of 50. In family life, men and women eat similar foods and have similar habits most of the time.
4. Men have higher stress levels compared to women, which leads to a higher probability of developing cancer. This hypothesis is possible because men have a higher incidence of many cancers than women. For example, the incidence of lung cancer, rectal cancer, and stomach cancer are significantly higher in men than in women, but the incidence of other non-malignant tumors is not significantly different between men and women.
5. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that biological differences between men and women contribute to the part of the differences in esophageal cancer incidence rates.

# Behavioral Risk

According to the above graph, it can be seen that although the incidence of esophageal cancer differs significantly between men and women, the difference in damage caused by esophageal cancer incidence is not significant. The ratio difference between DALY and incidence rate between men and women is not significant. Both in China and globally, the incidence of esophageal cancer is decreasing year by year, and at the same time DALY is also decreasing. This phenomenon may come from
- Global increase in nutritional levels, with more vegetables and fruits consumed reducing the risk of esophageal cancer
- Better medical care, which has improved the prognosis of esophageal cancer.

Note that although overall, the incidence of esophageal cancer has been decreasing year by year, the difference in incidence rates between men and women in China has not changed significantly. Therefore, the difference in incidence rates is more likely to stem from one or more of the more stable risk exposure. Also, it can be seen that the difference in incidence rates in China is significantly larger than the global. It is therefore speculated that cultural differences may also contribute to some of the risk exposure.
- This suggests that genetic and biological differences between men and women are not the main reason for the difference in incidence rates. The difference in incidence rates between men and women is gradually decreasing due to global data
- As the standard of living improves, the difference due to low fruit and vegetable diets should also decrease year by year. However, the Chinese data show that the difference is not decreasing, so the contribution of the difference due to dietary structure is probably low.
- It is therefore more likely to come from behavioral factors. These factors are more likely to be more stable over time.
    - For example, men eat more quickly and are more likely to ingest foods with higher temperatures, causing repeated scalding of the esophagus and raising the risk of cancer
    - Men drink more tea, and hot water is also an esophageal cancer risk factor
    - Esophageal burns caused by acid reflux from overeating
    - Burns caused by more alcohol intake

# Implications

Therefore, it is tentatively assumed that behavioral factors may contribute to the majority of the risk of esophageal cancer. For countries with similar situation, such as Japan and the UK, media publicity should be used to inform the public of the risks and to modify the possible cancer-causing behaviors of the public, after all, cancer prevention is more economical and efficient than cancer treatment.
